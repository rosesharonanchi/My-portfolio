# Rose Sharon Portfolio Website

Hi there! I'm Rose Sharon, and this is my digital home where I showcase what I'm passionate about - creating fun, interactive things with code and stunning visuals that truly stand out. As a Computer Engineering graduate with 2+ years of experience, I've built this portfolio under my Innotekh brand to share my journey from software engineering to specializing in React.js web development, mastering Adobe Photoshop for graphic design, and now exploring the fascinating world of data analytics. This single-page website represents not just my technical skills, but my belief that every great project starts with a simple conversation - whether you have a fully-fledged idea or just a spark of inspiration, I'm here to help you build it into a high-end digital reality that doesn't just look good, but performs exceptionally well.
